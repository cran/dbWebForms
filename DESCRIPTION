Title: Produce R Functions to Create HTML Forms Based on SQL Meta Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Timothy Conwell
Maintainer: Timothy Conwell <timconwell@gmail.com>
Description: Offers meta programming style tools to generate configurable R functions that produce HTML forms based on table input and SQL meta data. 
    Also generates functions for collecting the parameters of those HTML forms after they are submitted. Useful for 
    quickly generating HTML forms based on existing SQL tables. To use the resultant functions, the output files containing those functions must 
    be read into the R environment (perhaps using base::source()).
